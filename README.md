This app is an order book that updated in real-time with the token pairs selected. This app allows you add a selector of the trading token pairs, which in turn gets the order book of the selected pair. Also web socket is triggered that returns a real-time update of the order book.

Please for testing, use only WETH against USDC. P.S (0x Webhook was not functioning at the time of implementation. But it has been implemented regardless)
